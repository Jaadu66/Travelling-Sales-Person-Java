# Travelling Salesperson Problem using Best-First Search Algorithm in Java
This project is a university assignment that solves the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) using the Best-First Search algorithm implemented in Java. The goal of the TSP is to find the shortest possible route that visits a given set of cities and returns to the starting city, while visiting each city only once.

# Features
* Utilizes the Best-First Search algorithm to find an optimal solution for the TSP.
* Reads input data from text files.
* Provides a comprehensive solution to the TSP for academic purposes.


# Usage
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in your Java development environment.
* Ensure that the necessary input data text files are available.
* Compile and run the Java program.
* Follow the on-screen instructions to input the required parameters and obtain the solution to the TSP.


# Input Data Format
The project requires the input data to be provided in the form of text files. These text files serve as the source of information for the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) algorithm implemented in the project. The input data should be organized in a structured manner within these text files, allowing the program to read and process the data effectively.
